    <p>This is a Google Chrome extension that will automatically renew your CECIL session when you are ‘inactive’.</p>


    <h3 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h3>

    <p><strong>This extension is in no way affiliated with The University of Auckland. Use at your own risk.</strong>
    </p>

    <p>By using this extension, you accept that I (Leo Xiong) will not be held responsible for any (if any) violations
        of CECIL’s and/or The University of Auckland’s Terms of Service which may result in unwanted consequences. You
        are aware that you are disabling a security feature implemented to prevent unauthorized access to your account
        in the event that it is unintentionally left open on a public computer, and this extension will make your
        Auckland University account more vulnerable.</p>

    <h3 id="how-it-works">How it works</h3>

    <p><em>It’s a bit of a hack™</em></p>

    <p>The Chrome extension intercepts requests to <a href="https://cecil.auckland.ac.nz/Scripts/SessionAlert.js?">SessionAlert.js</a>
        and redirects it to a modified version included in the extension. The modified <a
                href="https://cecil.auckland.ac.nz/Scripts/SessionAlert.js">SessionAlert.js</a> bypasses the alert
        dialog and continues onto sending an XHR request to renew your session.</p>


    <h3 id="what-this-does">What this does</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Avoid seeing the ‘Your session will expire in 5 minutes…’ dialog every 55 minutes by renewing the session
            for you.
        </li>
    </ul>


    <h3 id="what-this-doesnt-do">What this doesn’t do</h3>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Keep your session if your computer is disconnected from the internet.</strong> This means if your
            computer is not able to send things over the internet, you will be logged out.
        </li>
        <li>Steal credentials.</li>
        <li>Log key strokes.</li>
        <li>Your laundry.</li>
    </ul>
